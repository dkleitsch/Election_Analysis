## Election Audit Summary
With just a few modifications, this Python script can easily be used to caluclate the results of any election.  You can have this script read any CSV file with election data or you could modify the type of file that it reads.  Then you just need to modify the row indexes associated with each variable to match the layout of the new election data file.  And that is it.  You are ready to conduct an election audit on any election using Python.
